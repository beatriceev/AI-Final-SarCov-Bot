  utter_covid_test:
  - text: |-
      Two types of COVID-19 tests are popular: the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test and the antigen test (rapid test). Both tests require a sample from the patient, usually a nasal swab. The rapid test is less accurate and cannot detect small amounts of the virus or asymptomatic cases like PCR.

      Note: People with positive results will have 2 lines shown on the Take-Home Rapid or PCR Test.
